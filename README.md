# EmailMaster
Welcome to EmailMaster!
This webapp was originally build by me as part of udemy course "Node with React: Fullstack Web Development" with instructor Stephen Grider.
As part of the corse tthe webapp was built with Node.js, Express.js for backend, MongoDB for database and React + Redux for forntend. Design was done with Materilize css.
After the course I redesigned the app integrating Material-ui for design and refactoring the code from class-based components into functional components and Typescript.
The webapp supports google authentication using oauth 2.0, sending email and collecting feedback with SendGrid api and credit card proccesing with Stripe checkout.
